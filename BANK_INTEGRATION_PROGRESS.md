# Bank Integration & Automation - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Foundations Complete âœ…

### What We've Built

#### 1. Database Schema (13 New Tables)

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `featureFlags` - Gradual feature rollout control
- `planEntitlements` - Tier limits and pricing configuration
- `institutions` - Plaid institution metadata
- `bankConnections` - User â†” bank links with encrypted tokens
- `accounts` - Bank accounts within connections
- `transactions` - Transaction data with deduplication
- `merchants` - Normalized merchant directory with aliases
- `detectionCandidates` - Pending subscription detections
- `auditLogs` - Security audit trail
- `organizations` - Family/Teams support (Phase 3 prep)
- `usageMeters` - Billing metering

**Enhanced Existing Tables:**
- `users` - Added 4 new tiers (plus, automate, family, teams), bank connection tracking, org support
- `subscriptions` - Added detection source, confidence score, merchant linking
- `notificationPreferences` - Added SMS, duplicate charge alerts, new subscription detection alerts
- `notificationQueue` - Added new alert types (new_subscription_detected, duplicate_charge)

#### 2. Configuration & Feature Flags

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` - Feature flag system with tier-based access control
- `src/lib/plan-entitlements.ts` - Complete tier definition with limits and pricing

**Tier Structure:**
- **Free (Track)** - 3 manual subs, no banks
- **Plus** - $5/mo, unlimited manual, no banks
- **Automate** - $9/mo, 1 bank included, detection, alerts, +$3/extra bank
- **Family** - $15/mo, 3 banks, 5 profiles, +$3/extra bank
- **Teams** - $49/mo, 5 users + 5 banks, API export, +$5/user, +$3/bank

#### 3. Plaid Integration

**Client Library:**
- `src/lib/plaid-client.ts` - Complete Plaid SDK wrapper
  - Link token creation
  - Public token exchange
  - Institution fetching
  - Account retrieval
  - Transaction sync (incremental with cursors)
  - Item management
  - Date range utilities

**API Routes:**
- `src/app/api/plaid/create-link-token/route.ts` - Generate link tokens
- `src/app/api/plaid/exchange-token/route.ts` - Complete connection setup flow
- `src/app/api/plaid/webhook/route.ts` - Handle Plaid webhooks (TRANSACTIONS, ITEM events)

#### 4. Convex Backend Functions

**Modules Created:**
- `convex/institutions.ts` - Institution CRUD with Plaid ID indexing
- `convex/bankConnections.ts` - Connection management with encryption, status tracking
- `convex/accounts.ts` - Account CRUD with balance tracking
- `convex/transactions.ts` - Bulk transaction operations with deduplication
- `convex/merchants.ts` - Merchant normalization with 10+ known providers seeded
- `convex/auditLogs.ts` - Security audit logging

**Key Features:**
- Encrypted access token storage (Convex built-in encryption)
- Connection status tracking (active, disconnected, error, requires_reauth)
- Transaction deduplication via SHA-256 hashing
- Incremental transaction sync with cursors
- Merchant alias matching (Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, etc.)
- Comprehensive audit logging

#### 5. Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "plaid": "^39.0.0",
  "stripe": "^19.1.0"
}
```

## What Works Now

### âœ… Complete Flows

1. **Link Token Creation**
   - User requests to connect bank
   - API generates Plaid Link token
   - Token includes webhook URL for updates

2. **Bank Connection Setup**
   - User completes Plaid Link flow
   - Public token exchanged for access token
   - Institution metadata fetched and stored
   - Accounts discovered and saved
   - Initial transaction sync (up to 90 days)
   - Connection marked active
   - Audit log created

3. **Webhook Processing**
   - Plaid sends TRANSACTIONS webhooks
   - System performs incremental sync
   - New/modified/removed transactions processed
   - Connection status updated on errors
   - Re-auth prompts for expired connections

4. **Data Security**
   - Access tokens encrypted at rest
   - Audit logs for sensitive operations
   - User ownership verification on all operations
   - Soft delete with data retention

## Environment Variables Needed

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Plaid Configuration
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox  # or development, production

# Site URL for webhooks
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Existing vars
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=hearty-leopard-116
# ... (rest of existing vars)
```

- [ ] Connection disconnect + data deletion
- [ ] Overage purchase flow

### E2E Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Automate user: link bank â†’ detect subs â†’ schedule alert

## Known Issues & TODOs

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**
   - Currently stubbed in `plaid-client.ts`
   - Need to implement actual signature verification

2. **Sync Cursor Storage**
   - Currently updating `lastSyncedAt` timestamp
   - Need dedicated field in schema for cursor persistence

3. **Error Handling**
   - Need comprehensive error boundary for Plaid API failures
   - Retry logic for failed webhooks

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Plaid: 100 req/sec limit
   - Need batch processing for bulk syncs

5. **Merchant Logo URLs**
   - Need to integrate logo API or CDN
   - Fallback to default icons

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before production:
- [ ] Plaid env switched from sandbox â†’ production
- [ ] Webhook URL registered in Plaid Dashboard
- [ ] Access token encryption verified
- [ ] Privacy policy reviewed and published
- [ ] Feature flags configured for gradual rollout
- [ ] Stripe webhook configured for overage billing
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting for webhook failures

## Metrics to Track

**Activation Funnel:**
- `bank_link_started` â†’ `bank_link_success` â†’ `subs_detected` â†’ `subs_confirmed` â†’ `first_alert_sent`

**Detection Quality:**
- Precision: accepted / (accepted + dismissed)
- Recall: detected / total_actual_subscriptions
- Confidence distribution histogram

**Revenue:**
- Overage purchases by tier
- Tier upgrades attributed to bank features
- Churn rate for users with/without banks

**Reliability:**
- Webhook processing latency
- Sync failure rate
- Plaid API error rate

- Gmail/Outlook OAuth integration
- Receipt parsing service
- Backfill missing subscriptions
- Attach receipts to merchants

## Phase 3 Preview (Family & Teams)

Will add:
- Organization management
- Profile roles and permissions
