# üöÄ VERCEL PRODUCTION FIX - TIER DETECTION

## ‚úÖ Plan ID Identified

Your Premium Plan ID: `cplan_32xfUNaavPmbOI3V7AtOq7EiPqM`

## üîß IMMEDIATE VERCEL FIX

Since you're testing on Vercel production (`usesubwise.app`), you need to:

### Step 1: Verify Environment Variable in Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `subscription-tracker` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID` is set to: `cplan_32xfUNaavPmbOI3V7AtOq7EiPqM`

### Step 2: Redeploy to Apply Changes
Even if the environment variable exists, you need to redeploy for it to take effect:

```bash
# Option 1: Force redeploy (trigger new build)
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy for env var fix"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Redeploy from Vercel dashboard
# Go to Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí Redeploy
```

### Step 3: Test Production Webhook
After redeployment, test your webhook configuration:

```
GET https://usesubwise.app/api/debug/webhook-check
```

## üîç PRODUCTION DEBUGGING URLS

I've created these endpoints for your production testing:

### Check Webhook Configuration
```
https://usesubwise.app/api/debug/webhook-check
```
This shows if your plan ID matches what webhooks receive.

### Debug Tier Status  
```
https://usesubwise.app/debug-tier
```
Complete tier detection analysis and manual sync.

### Force Tier Sync
```
POST https://usesubwise.app/api/sync/tier
```
Manual tier sync that bypasses webhook dependencies.

## üéØ EXPECTED WEBHOOK BEHAVIOR

With plan ID `cplan_32xfUNaavPmbOI3V7AtOq7EiPqM` properly set, your webhook should:

1. ‚úÖ Receive `subscription.updated` event
2. ‚úÖ Extract `plan_id: "cplan_32xfUNaavPmbOI3V7AtOq7EiPqM"`  
3. ‚úÖ Match against environment variable
4. ‚úÖ Upgrade user to premium_user
5. ‚úÖ Update Clerk metadata
6. ‚úÖ Update Convex database

## üö® QUICK PRODUCTION TEST

Right now, test if it's working:

1. **Visit:** https://usesubwise.app/debug-tier
2. **Check:** Does it show you as premium or free?  
3. **If free:** Click "Force Sync Tier"
4. **Result:** Should upgrade you to premium immediately

## üìä WEBHOOK SUCCESS INDICATORS

After the fix, your Clerk webhook logs should show:
```
‚úÖ User upgraded to premium successfully
```

Instead of:
```
‚ùå PLAN ID MISMATCH - Not upgrading user
```
