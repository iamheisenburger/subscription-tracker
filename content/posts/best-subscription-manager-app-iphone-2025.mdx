Fact-check summary of the article “Best Subscription Manager App iPhone (2025)” against the provided sources:

Findings (by claim cluster):

1) Existence / positioning of named services
- UseSubwise: Supported as a service for subscription tracking and budget management (source: usesubwise.app). The article’s general characterization that UseSubwise is a subscription-tracking/budget tool is consistent with the site title. Specific assertions about being the “best overall for iPhone,” exact pricing ($3.99/mo), detailed iOS-native UI elements (Apple Watch, Siri shortcuts), family sharing behavior, and privacy guarantees ("does not sell data") are not fully verifiable from the single provided UseSubwise entry alone — they require checking UseSubwise’s product pages and privacy policy directly for confirmation.
- Rocket Money (formerly Truebill): Supported. Rocket Money’s site describes subscription detection, cancellation tools, and services to reduce bills; the site is the appropriate source for claims about their automation and negotiation features. The article’s statement that Rocket Money may charge fees/retain a commission for negotiation is consistent with how such services are commonly described, but specific fee ranges or commission percentages should be confirmed on Rocket Money’s pricing/terms pages.
- Mint (Intuit) and PocketGuard: Supported as broader budgeting apps that include subscription/bill tracking features (sources mint.intuit.com and pocketguard.com). The article’s positioning of them as budgeting-first apps that include subscription views is consistent with those sites’ purposes.

2) Bank connectivity and security
- Plaid: Supported as a provider of secure account connectivity and read-only access patterns; plaid.com documents secure bank connections and is a valid reference for the general statement that many apps use third-party aggregators for transaction import.
- The article’s general security recommendations (prefer read-only connectors, enable 2FA, review connected apps, export/delete data) are best-practice guidance. Plaid supports the idea of using third-party connectors to avoid direct credential entry, but confirmation that a given app (e.g., UseSubwise) uses Plaid or similar must be verified on that app’s site or privacy/technical docs.

3) Market/industry context claims
- Deloitte, McKinsey, Statista: These organizations regularly publish analysis and data on the subscription economy and consumer subscription trends (sources: www2.deloitte.com, www.mckinsey.com, www.statista.com). Citing them to support the general claim that the subscription economy has grown and that subscriptions are an important consumer-finance category is reasonable. However, specific numeric claims in the article (for example: "many households juggle a dozen or more recurring payments" or precise average household subscription spend in 2025) are not validated here because the provided source links are to the organizations’ top-level domains rather than to specific reports or data tables. To verify any specific statistics you should link to the exact Deloitte/McKinsey/Statista report or chart.

4) Apps not in the provided sources
- Bobby and Subby: The article makes multiple claims about these apps (pricing, one-time fees, device-local storage, privacy). Neither Bobby nor Subby appear among the provided source list, so their specific feature/pricing claims are unverified by the supplied sources and should be checked against the apps’ official pages or app-store listings.

5) Feature-level claims across apps (auto-import, CSV import, calendar view, negotiation/cancellation flows, family sharing, export/delete)
- General patterns (some subscription managers offer automatic bank-import via connectors, others offer manual entry or CSV import, some offer cancellation/negotiation assistance) are supported at a high level by Rocket Money’s site (automation, cancellation, negotiation) and by Plaid’s role in secure connectors. Mint and PocketGuard being budgeting-first with transaction import is supported by their sites. However, app-by-app specifics in the article (e.g., which apps support CSV import, which have calendar views, which store data at rest encrypted, which explicitly “do not sell data”) should be verified against each vendor’s product pages and privacy/security documentation.

Conclusions & recommended verification steps
- Supported (general): Rocket Money offers transaction scanning and cancellation/negotiation services (rocketmoney.com); Plaid provides secure account connectivity and read-only patterns (plaid.com); Mint and PocketGuard are broader budgeting apps with subscription/bill features (mint.intuit.com, pocketguard.com); Deloitte/McKinsey/Statista are appropriate sources for subscription-economy analysis.
- Partially supported / requires vendor verification: UseSubwise is a subscription-tracking/budget tool (usesubwise.app), but the article’s many detailed claims about UseSubwise’s exact features, pricing, privacy guarantees, and platform-specific UI behaviors should be verified on UseSubwise’s official product pages and privacy policy.
- Unsupported by the provided sources: Specific claims about Bobby and Subby (features, pricing, privacy) and several granular product comparisons in the table are not verifiable with the supplied source set.

If you want, I can: (a) fetch specific product pages & privacy policies for UseSubwise, Rocket Money, Mint, PocketGuard, and the negotiation/cancellation terms from Rocket Money to confirm the precise claims; or (b) produce a revised article that marks unverified claims clearly and cites the exact vendor pages and reports from Deloitte/McKinsey/Statista for any numeric statistics.
