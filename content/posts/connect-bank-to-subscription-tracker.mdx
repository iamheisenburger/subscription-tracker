Verification summary — key article claims and status

- "Linking your bank to a subscription tracker is the fastest way to discover...": Partially supported. Industry connectors (Plaid, Yodlee, MX) are the typical mechanisms apps use to read transactions (supported by Plaid docs). The phrase "fastest way" is a product claim and not verifiable in the provided sources.

- "Recent U.S. surveys place average monthly subscription spend between $37 and $91": Not verified in the provided Self Financial link. Self Financial's piece documents that consumers often underestimate subscription costs and reports on the cost of unused paid subscriptions, but the exact $37–$91 range is not clearly corroborated by the linked Self Financial page in the provided sources.

- "Apps generally use Plaid Link / bank OAuth, user authenticates, connector returns an access token (read-only)" : Supported. Plaid's docs describe Link and the typical token/exchange pattern; third‑party connectors commonly issue tokens scoped for reading transactions (see Plaid docs and Plaid Recurring Transactions docs). Read‑only access is a common configuration, though actual scopes depend on implementation.

- "Read‑only tokens cannot move money": Supported in principle. Explanatory vendor/security pages (example: Balance Budget guide) and aggregator docs describe read‑only configurations that do not allow debits/transfers. Implementation details and scopes vary by provider.

- "Plaid’s Recurring Transactions endpoint summarizes identified recurring outflows with merchant, frequency, and typical amounts": Supported. Plaid provides a recurring transactions product/endpoint that returns recurring streams and metadata useful for subscription detection (see Plaid Transactions / recurring endpoint docs and related references).

- "Request at least 180 days (some recommend 365) to identify annual cycles": Partially supported. Longer history improves detection accuracy; however, the specific 180‑day minimum is a best practice / recommendation and not an explicit, universal requirement in the provided Plaid docs. Plaid docs discuss historical updates and available history windows but do not mandate a single day count across all integrations.

- "Apps cannot access raw bank passwords; connector handles auth": Supported. Modern connector flows (e.g., Plaid Link) perform authentication in the connector UI so the third‑party app does not receive raw credentials (see Plaid docs).

- "If a tracker offers cancellation/concierge, it will require additional authority/payment capabilities; tokenization (Stripe) is standard": Supported. Services that cancel or change payment methods typically require additional permissions and storage of payment instruments; Stripe and other PSPs are commonly used for tokenization and vaulting (see Stripe DPA / tokenization references). Rocket Money support and product documentation illustrate that concierge services involve additional flows/permissions.

- "Security checklist items (TLS, AES‑256 at rest, SOC 2/ISO)": Supported as industry best practices. Balance Budget and vendor pages reference encryption and vendor certifications as trust signals; Stripe’s DPA and other vendor materials document data processing commitments. Exact encryption standards and certifications should be verified per vendor.

- "CFPB finalized rules under Section 1033 (Oct 2024) standardize consumer access...": Partially supported. The CFPB page in the provided sources documents required rulemaking on personal financial data rights; use that page for authoritative status and timeline. The precise date claim (Oct 2024) should be checked against the CFPB page or official announcements for accuracy.

- "Payment method impacts churn (cards vs ACH)": Supported. GoCardless/Zuora analysis and summaries report that payment method affects retention/churn characteristics.

- UX and troubleshooting recommendations (consent screens, disconnect options, CSV fallback, connect multiple accounts): These are reasonable best practices and are consistent with vendor docs and help center patterns (e.g., Plaid docs, Rocket Money help), but product-specific claims ("scan completes in under X minutes", "30‑second setup") are marketing statements and not verified by the provided docs.

Overall assessment: The article's technical descriptions of how aggregators and Plaid-like flows work, the existence of recurring‑detection endpoints, and the high‑level security and regulatory considerations are supported by the provided sources. Numerical claims (the $37–$91 monthly range, the Oct 2024 finalization date) and timing/marketing claims should be revised or explicitly sourced to an authoritative item before publication.
