# How to Use Subwise — Complete Onboarding & Setup Guide

A practical, step-by-step how-to for new users who want to set up Subwise, add subscriptions, track renewals, and get to value fast. This guide combines a concise quick-start, a detailed numbered HowTo flow you can follow in under five minutes, best practices for Subwise onboarding, measurement KPIs product teams should track, troubleshooting, a comparison table, pro tips, and a 10-question FAQ you can reuse in help-center markup.

Why this guide matters: getting new users to the "aha"—their first recorded subscription and visible monthly total—predicts retention. Use this article to reduce Time-To-First-Value (TTFV), improve Day-7 retention, and give users a clear, low-friction path to adopting Subwise.

---

## What Subwise Does

Subwise is a lightweight subscription tracker available as iPhone/iPad/macOS apps and a Chrome extension. It helps users collect, organize, and monitor recurring payments so they can see monthly and yearly costs at a glance. Core product functions (as described in the app/extension listings) include:

- **Add subscriptions from a pre-populated library** (reported 120+ services) or **create custom subscriptions**.
- **Set billing frequency** (weekly/monthly/yearly) and **assign a payment method label** for personal tracking.
- **Set renewal reminders** and choose lead time (e.g., 1 day/3 days/1 week).
- **View a dashboard** that compares monthly vs. yearly totals and renders visual charts for quick analysis.
- **Add notes and icons** to entries for clarity, and **swipe to mark items canceled** (behavior varies by platform/version).
- **Local / local-first storage** on device — the app listings describe local-first behavior so your data remains on your device unless you export or use any available sync feature. ([App Store — Subwise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subwise-subscription-tracker/id6741874006))

Why this matters to you: Subwise gives a fast, privacy-conscious way to catalog and control subscriptions without linking bank accounts — ideal for users who prefer manual control and local storage.

---

## Quick Start — Install & Sign In (2 minutes)

Prerequisites:

- iPhone, iPad, or macOS device (check the App Store listing for minimum OS requirements and compatibility). ([App Store — Subwise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subwise-subscription-tracker/id6741874006))
- Chrome desktop for the browser extension (check the Chrome Web Store listing for requirements).

Quick steps:

1. **Install the app** from the App Store or add the Subwise Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. **Open Subwise** and grant optional permissions (notifications if you want reminders).
3. **Create a local profile** if prompted — many users can start without creating cloud accounts.

Expected result: the app opens to a clean dashboard with a CTA to "Add subscription" or the extension toolbar shows the Subwise icon ready to add entries.

---

## Step-by-Step: Add Your First Subscription (HowTo — 1 of 6)

Follow this numbered HowTo to get your first subscription recorded and to see the dashboard update. Keep these steps short so your Time-To-First-Value (TTFV) is minimal.

1. **Open Subwise** (Step 1 of 6)
   - Tap the Subwise icon on your device or open the Chrome extension.
   - Expected result: you land on the Subwise dashboard where the main CTA reads something like "Add subscription".

2. **Tap Add / New Subscription** (Step 2 of 6)
   - Choose **Browse library** or **Add custom**.
   - Expected result: a searchable library of popular services appears (the listing reports 120+ services). ([App Store — Subwise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subwise-subscription-tracker/id6741874006))

3. **Select or create the service** (Step 3 of 6)
   - If the service is in the library, tap it to pre-fill the name and icon.
   - If not, choose **Add custom** and type the service name.
   - Expected result: a new subscription card opens with name and icon ready to edit.

4. **Set the price and billing cadence** (Step 4 of 6)
   - Enter the subscription price and choose cadence: **weekly**, **monthly**, or **yearly**.
   - Add the payment method label (e.g., Visa, PayPal) for personal tracking.
   - Expected result: the item shows cost and cadence in the entry preview.

5. **Set renewal reminders and notes** (Step 5 of 6)
   - Choose a reminder lead time (1 day / 3 days / 1 week) and add an optional note (e.g., promo end date, free trial length).
   - Expected result: the subscription will populate Upcoming Renewals and will trigger a local notification at the chosen time (notifications depend on device settings).

6. **Save and confirm on the dashboard** (Step 6 of 6)
   - Tap Save. You should immediately see the subscription in your list and the dashboard totals updated (monthly/annual charts).
   - Expected result: you can see your new monthly total increase and an entry in the upcoming renewals list.

Why this flow works: it keeps the core onboarding to a few essential actions (install, add, set reminder, view dashboard). Short flows are proven to increase activation rates and reduce early churn. ([ProductLed — Onboarding](https://productled.com/book/onboarding?utm_source=openai))

Screenshots & visual guidance: include 3–4 annotated screenshots showing: (1) Add screen, (2) Library selection, (3) [Pricing](/pricing) & cadence fields, (4) Dashboard with updated totals. Use descriptive alt text for accessibility.

---

## Organize & Customize

After adding subscriptions, keep your list actionable with naming, icons, categories, and payment tags.

- **Icons and notes**: assign recognizable icons to speed scanning. Add notes like trial end date, linked email, or promo codes.
- **Payment method tags**: use these to group subscriptions charged to the same card or PayPal — useful when reconciling bank statements.
- **Categories**: create logical groups (Entertainment, Utilities, Productivity, Hobby) so you can filter and spot cost centers quickly.
- **Active vs canceled**: swipe to mark an item **Canceled** — Subwise may preserve canceled items in history so you can audit changes later (behavior varies by version).

Expected result: better scanning, faster decision-making, and easier cancellations when you identify cost-heavy categories.

---

## Track Renewals & Set Reminders

Subwise reminder control is simple but effective. Use reminders to avoid surprise charges and to plan cancellations during free trials.

How to set reminders:

1. Open a subscription entry.
2. Choose **Renewal reminder** and pick lead time: **1 day**, **3 days**, **1 week** (options may vary).
3. Save.

What you’ll see: the subscription will appear in the Upcoming Renewals list and trigger a local push/notification at your chosen lead time, subject to your device notification settings.

Pro tip: set trial subscriptions to remind you 1–3 days before the trial ends — this prevents accidental renewals and gives you time to evaluate value.

Privacy note: the app listings describe a local-first approach to storage and notifications; reminders typically use local device notifications and do not require cloud storage unless you opt into a sync/export feature. ([App Store — Subwise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subwise-subscription-tracker/id6741874006))

---

## Dashboard & Analytics — Monthly vs Yearly

The dashboard is the control center. Key elements:

- **Monthly vs yearly totals**: toggle to view your spending for comparative decisions.
- **Visual charts**: quick identification of the most expensive subscriptions and trends across months.
- **Upcoming Renewals**: at-a-glance list of near-term charges.

How to use the dashboard effectively:

- **Start with totals**: verify your monthly total — this is your immediate TTFV metric: the moment you see your real monthly spend in the app.
- **Drill into categories**: filter to find the top 3 costs and consider trimming or downgrading them.
- **Leverage notes**: if a subscription is promotional, mark the promo end date so you get a secondary reminder.

Expected result: you can decide within minutes whether to cancel, downgrade, or keep subscriptions based on cost and usage.

---

## Advanced Tips

These suggestions help power users and product teams get more from Subwise.

- **Bulk import ideas**: Subwise primarily focuses on manual or library-based entry. For heavy importers, create a short spreadsheet of subscriptions and then add them quickly using the app's Add custom flow. Consider adding the most expensive items first to get highest TTFV.
- **Tagging conventions**: use consistent tags (e.g., AMZ for Amazon Prime, NET for Netflix family) to enable quick filtering. Tags can double as reconciliation notes for payments.
- **Use icons to reduce scan time**: assign unique icons to streaming services and financial tools so you can visually identify them faster.
- **Keep canceled items for audit**: mark subscriptions canceled rather than deleting them. This preserves history and helps analyze churn in your subscription habit.
- **Privacy & local storage**: the app and extension listings describe local-first behavior — avoid sending sensitive data into cloud services unless you choose to export or enable a sync feature. ([App Store — Subwise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subwise-subscription-tracker/id6741874006))

Expected result: a cleaner, faster-to-scan list that surfaces your biggest savings opportunities.

---

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

If you run into issues, these checks resolve the majority of problems.

- **App won't show library items**:
  - Ensure you have the latest app or extension version installed.
  - Restart the app/extension; library items are packaged with the app or loaded on first use.

- **Reminders not firing**:
  - Confirm device notifications are enabled for Subwise.
  - Check reminder lead time and local date/time settings.

- **Dashboard totals seem wrong**:
  - Verify cadence (monthly vs yearly) for each item; annual subscriptions should be converted to monthly equivalents or toggled with the dashboard view.
  - Look for duplicate entries.

- **Sync/backup concerns**:
  - The app listings emphasize local-first storage — if you need cloud sync, check the app settings or export data manually and store it where you control access.

If problems persist, consult the Subwise help page or contact developer support via the app listing. Include app version, device model, and a screenshot of the issue for faster resolution.

---

## Measuring Success: KPIs to Track for Subwise Onboarding

Product and marketing teams should instrument onboarding to measure outcomes. Recommended KPIs:

- **Activation rate**: % of new installs where a user adds at least one subscription and views the dashboard. Track Day-0, Day-1, and Day-7 cohorts. ([Pendo — Onboarding](https://www.pendo.io/resources/getting-started-with-in-app-onboarding/?utm_source=openai))
- **Onboarding completion rate**: % of users who complete the HowTo flow (Install → Add subscription → Set reminder).
- **Time-To-First-Value (TTFV)**: median time from install to first subscription recorded. Shorter TTFV correlates with higher retention. ([ProductLed — Onboarding](https://productled.com/book/onboarding?utm_source=openai))
- **Day-7 retention**: percent of users returning after 7 days — a leading indicator for long-term retention.
- **Support ticket reduction**: measure number of onboarding-related tickets before and after publishing video + step-by-step help. Teams that add concise video and step instructions often report reductions in onboarding support requests; results vary by organization and baseline support volume. ([Guidde — Onboarding Video Guide](https://www.guidde.com/knowledge-hub/customer-onboarding-video-examples-guide?utm_source=openai))

Implement event tracking for these milestones (install, add-subscription, set-reminder, view-dashboard) and use them to iterate on the onboarding flow.

## How-to SEO & Distribution Recommendations (for the website)

If you publish this guide on usesubwise.app follow these SEO best practices to improve visibility and usability:

- **Use the primary keyword in the H1**: "how to use Subwise" and include secondary keywords naturally (Subwise onboarding, set up subscription tracker, add subscriptions Subwise, Subwise tutorial).
- **Numbered HowTo steps**: use a short ordered list for the main procedure — this aligns with HowTo schema and improves eligibility for rich results. ([Agenxus — HowTo Content](https://agenxus.com/[Blog](/blog)/howto-faq-content-optimization-ai-citations?utm_source=openai))
- **Add HowTo JSON-LD and FAQ schema** for the ordered steps and FAQ block; validate with Google's Rich Results Test and fix errors quickly. ([Developers — FAQ structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage?utm_source=openai))
- **Embed a short demo video (60–120s)** near the top and again in the detailed steps. Provide a full transcript for accessibility and crawlability. Video-based onboarding improves retention and learning speed. ([Wyzowl — Video Onboarding](https://wyzowl.com/onboarding-users-with-video/?utm_source=openai))
- **Use descriptive alt text for screenshots** and include anchors for one-click navigation to major steps (improves dwell time).
- **Provide a printable checklist PDF** (optional) and link from the article.

Distribution tips:

- Publish short 30–90s demo clips for social platforms and link back to the full guide.

## Comparison Table: Subwise vs Alternatives

| Feature / Option | Subwise (app/extension) | Manual Spreadsheet | Bank-Connected Subscription Apps |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Speed to first value | Fast (add one item, see totals) | Medium (enter items manually) | Fast if bank connections auto-detect; may require linking accounts |
| Privacy | Local/local-first storage (device-only as described in listings) | Local file (highest privacy) | Requires bank connections/cloud storage (lower privacy) |
| Visual dashboard | Yes — monthly vs yearly charts | Depends on spreadsheet skill | Yes, often more advanced analytics |
| Library of services | Built-in library (reported 120+ services) | No | Some apps have detection, but accuracy varies |
| Reminders / notifications | Built-in (local notifications) | Manual calendar reminders | Built-in (cloud push) |
| Best for | Users who want lightweight, private tracking | Users comfortable with spreadsheets | Users who want automated detection via bank [Integrations](/integrations) |

Takeaway: Subwise balances privacy, simplicity, and quick TTFV. It’s an excellent middle ground for users who want more structure than a spreadsheet without sharing financial credentials.

## Pro Tips (Power-user and Product Team Recommendations)

- **Prioritize the top 5 costs first**: when you first install, add the five most expensive recurring charges to see your biggest potential savings immediately.
- **Use consistent naming**: make reconciliation with bank statements easier by using the merchant name exactly as it appears on your card.
- **Short demo video**: create a 60–120s screencast that shows install → add subscription → set reminder → view dashboard. Host it near the top of the article and use the transcript beneath the video. Video onboarding increases retention and speeds time-to-value. ([Wyzowl — Video Impact](https://wyzowl.com/onboarding-users-with-video/?utm_source=openai))
- **A/B test onboarding flows**: try two flows — a minimal 3-step flow vs. a guided 6-step flow with tooltips — and measure Activation and Day-7 retention. ([Pendo — Onboarding](https://www.pendo.io/resources/getting-started-with-in-app-onboarding/?utm_source=openai))
- **Reminders strategy**: set reminders for trials at 1–3 days before expiry and for annual renewals at 1 week to give time for action.
- **Export for backup**: periodically export your subscription list as CSV for personal backups or tax/expense planning if the app version you use supports export.
