Fact-check summary — key points supported vs. not supported by the provided sources:

Supported or reasonably inferred
- Recurring subscription costs are an increasingly important part of consumer spending and the subscription economy is growing (Harvard Business Review; Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey).
- Creating an inventory of subscriptions by checking bank and card statements is recommended (Consumer Reports). Exporting 12 months of statements to find recurring charges is standard budgeting advice (Consumer Reports; NerdWallet).
- Converting annual charges to a monthly equivalent (annual ÷ 12) and using a sinking fund for annual bills is a standard budgeting method (NerdWallet; Consumer Reports offers guidance on tracking recurring charges).
- Using a tracker or app to detect recurring charges, send renewal alerts, and consolidate subscriptions is recommended (Consumer Reports discusses subscription-tracking approaches and tools).
- Categorizing subscriptions and reviewing them regularly to identify unused or duplicate services is consistent with Consumer Reports and general budgeting best practices (Consumer Reports; NerdWallet).

Not supported or not found in the provided sources
- Specific numeric caps presented as authoritative rules (e.g., “cap subscription spending between 3% and 10% of net monthly income,” “many people aim to keep subscriptions under 5%–10% of net income,” or fixed caps like $25–$75/mo) are not documented in the supplied sources. The sources discuss budgeting recurring expenses but do not establish these precise percentage or dollar-rule thresholds.
- The named third‑party app usesubwise.app and its claimed behaviors (automatic import, set monthly limits, alerts) are not mentioned in the provided sources. Those app-specific claims are unsupported by these citations.
- Exact subscription prices and the specific example line-item prices (Netflix $15.99, Spotify $9.99, Adobe $52.99/year converted to $4.42/mo, etc.) are illustrative in the article but are not verified by the provided sources.

Partial / reasonable recommendations with limited direct sourcing
- Quarterly deep reviews and monthly quick checks are reasonable and align with personal finance guidance to review budgets regularly (NerdWallet recommends monthly budgeting; Consumer Reports recommends regular tracking), but the exact cadence (“quarterly” for deep reviews, “every 90 days” audit) is a practical recommendation rather than a fully sourced prescription in these materials.
- Practical steps such as consolidating subscriptions on one card, enabling transaction alerts, downgrading plans, sharing family plans, and negotiating retention offers are commonly recommended tactics in consumer-advice writing; Consumer Reports and NerdWallet discuss many of these strategies in concept, though not each specific tactic with data-backed thresholds.

Bottom line
- The article’s overall workflow (inventory → normalize → categorize/prioritize → set limits → automate & review) and emphasis on visibility and tracking are consistent with the guidance in the provided sources. However, numeric rules-of-thumb, named third‑party app behaviors, and specific price examples should be presented as illustrative suggestions rather than cited facts unless verified by up-to-date sources.
