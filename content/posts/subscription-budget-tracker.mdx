Summary of verification

Most of the article's factual claims are supported by the supplied sources, with a few places that need qualification or that cite material not present in the provided source set.

Supported or reasonably supported claims

- CNET survey summary: TheDesk coverage is consistent with the article's citation that a recent CNET-focused summary reported average U.S. subscription spend near $90/month (~$1,080/year) and estimated roughly $200/year wasted on unused subscriptions. (TheDesk — CNET summary)
- Lower alternate average: Self Financial reports a notably lower average subscription figure (the article cites ~$37/month). The Self Financial piece documents a lower headline figure and explains methodological differences that can produce divergent averages. (Self Financial)
- Industry compendium: The Whop subscription statistics compendium includes metrics such as average number of subscriptions per consumer (the article cites ~8.2) and a mid-range monthly-spend figure (~$118/month for 2024 in the compendium). (Whop)
- Regulatory context: The Paul Hastings client alert documents updated California and FTC auto-renewal regulation activity and timing; Perkins Coie coverage likewise discusses the FTC "click-to-cancel"/negative-option developments. These sources support the article's statement that regulators are tightening rules around auto-renew/negative-option practices and that consumer-facing cancelation protections are changing. (Paul Hastings; Perkins Coie)
- Automation vs privacy and features: Guidance on tradeoffs between automated bank/card linking and manual trackers, and the typical feature set described for trackers (inventory, renewal alerts, usage signals, etc.), aligns with practical guidance in the GoBankingRates piece and Rocket Money (Truebill) documentation. (GoBankingRates; Rocket Money)
- Templates exist: The article's statement that Google Sheets subscription-tracker templates are available is supported by the YouAreLovedTemplates example. (YouAreLovedTemplates)
- App capabilities: Rocket Money (Truebill) feature descriptions (auto-discovery, cancellation help, negotiation services) are consistent with the article's characterization of that app. The GoBankingRates comparison also supports the inclusion of apps like PocketGuard and Trim as common options. (Rocket Money; GoBankingRates)

Claims that need qualification or are not verifiable from the supplied sources

- Unit / population clarity on averages: The article quotes multiple averages ($90/mo, $37/mo, $118/mo) from different sources. Those differences arise from methodology (household vs individual, which services counted, sample selection). The article should explicitly note for each cited figure whether it refers to individuals or households and which categories were included, because the supplied sources use different methods and populations. (See Self Financial and Whop for methodological notes.)
- "Many consumers can recover $150–$300/year by cancelling what they don’t use": TheDesk/CNET summary reports roughly $200/year wasted, which supports the midpoint of that range, but the specific $150–$300 range is not explicitly stated in the supplied sources. That range is plausible given the cited $200 figure, but it is not a direct citation in the provided material and should be attributed as an estimate or adjusted to cite the $200 figure specifically. (TheDesk)
- Behavioral rule citation ("For every new subscription you add, cancel one existing subscription"): The article attributes this to an external consumer-journalism recommendation (NYPost link in the article) but that NYPost source was not included in the provided source set, so that specific citation cannot be verified here. Either provide a verifiable source for that rule or present it as an editorial suggestion rather than a sourced fact.
- usesubwise.app recommendation: The article recommends usesubwise.app as a ready-made option but that site was not among the supplied sources; this specific endorsement is not verifiable from the provided source list and should be removed or replaced with a cited alternative from the provided sources (e.g., Rocket Money / GoBankingRates recommendations).
- Some operational claims (e.g., "one-click comparisons", "automated detection of price changes") are product-level features that may apply to some trackers and not others; they are plausible and partly supported by Rocket Money / GoBankingRates descriptions, but readers should be warned that feature availability varies by app and by subscription plan (free vs paid). (Rocket Money; GoBankingRates)

Suggested edits to improve accuracy

1. For each numeric average (e.g., $90/mo, $37/mo, $118/mo, ~8.2 subscriptions), add a parenthetical clarifying the population/methodology (individual vs household, year, whether app-store paid or total recurring charges) and cite the exact source.
2. Replace the uncited behavioral-rule citation (NYPost) with either a neutral phrasing ("a commonly recommended rule of thumb is...") or add the NYPost source to the source list if you intend to keep the direct citation.
3. Remove or verify the usesubwise.app recommendation unless you can supply a supporting citation from the provided source set.
4. Change the phrasing of the $150–$300/year recovery claim to reference the CNET-summary figure explicitly (e.g., "CNET's summary found about $200/year wasted on unused subscriptions, so many consumers can recover around that amount by cancelling unused services").
5. When listing app features, add a brief note that specific features and pricing differ by provider and by plan (free vs premium) and advise readers to check each provider's current documentation.

Conclusion

The article's central points (subscription proliferation, the usefulness of a tracker, automation vs privacy tradeoffs, and steps for a short audit) are consistent with the supplied sources. A few numeric and promotional claims should be clarified, and two external recommendations (NYPost-sourced rule and usesubwise.app) are not verifiable from the provided source set and should be corrected or removed.
