Fact-check summary

Supported claims
- The broad growth and significance of the subscription economy is supported by industry research (Zuora) and consulting analysis (McKinsey) that describe the increasing prevalence of subscription business models and market trends. (See Zuora; McKinsey.)
- Common features listed for subscription management apps — bank/card sync, renewal alerts, spending analytics, CSV export, shared accounts, cancellation assistance — are consistent with feature sets shown on vendor sites such as Rocket Money and Mint. (See Rocket Money; Mint.)
- Consumer risks around automatic renewals and the need to watch cancellation/renewal policies are supported by FTC guidance on automatic renewals and consumer protections. (See FTC.)

Unsupported or unverified claims (hallucinations or lacking source)
- All detailed, line-by-line pricing and feature claims for "Subwise" (plan names, monthly/annual prices, exact trial length, feature gates per tier, percent savings for annual billing, and business-level SSO/SOC2 claims) are not supported by the provided sources. No source in the provided list documents a product named Subwise or the specific prices and trial terms asserted in the article.
- Specific numeric comparisons in the competitor table (for example, Rocket Money listed as "$3–$12") are presented without a direct citation in the provided sources. Rocket Money does offer free and paid services and negotiation features (Rocket Money site), but exact price ranges should be verified on the vendor site before publishing.
- Statements that claim precise savings percentages for annual billing ("save ~17%" or "15–20%") are not substantiated by the provided sources and vary by vendor and promotion. These percentage-savings figures should be removed or qualified unless a vendor page is cited.
- Claims about features labelled as "planned" or availability of fully managed cancellation for Subwise (or exact gating of features by plan) are unverified.

Recommended edits to the article
1) Remove or clearly label the entire "Subwise pricing — plans, free trial, and what's included" section as unverified/example content unless you can provide an authoritative vendor source (pricing page or documentation) for Subwise. If Subwise is a real product, cite its official pricing/support pages for each asserted price and feature.
2) Replace hard numeric claims about annual savings (e.g., "save ~17%") with a neutral statement such as: "Vendors often offer a discount for annual billing; the percentage varies by vendor—check the provider's pricing page for current discounts." Cite vendor pages for specific discounts.
3) For competitor pricing comparisons, avoid specific price ranges unless you cite each vendor's current pricing page. Instead state features that are verifiable: e.g., "Rocket Money offers free and paid tiers and negotiation features" (cite Rocket Money); "Mint is a free, ad-supported budgeting app with bank sync" (cite Mint).
4) For statements about security certifications (SOC2, ISO) and SSO for enterprise plans, require vendor documentation before attributing those certifications to a specific product. The FTC and general guidance recommend checking security claims; cite FTC for consumer-protection context and each vendor for their stated certifications.
5) For the ROI examples, label the numeric example as illustrative and keep it generic; these calculations are reasonable as a methodology but the outcome depends on user inputs. No vendor-specific ROI claims should be made without evidence.

If you want, I can produce a corrected draft of the article with the Subwise pricing section removed or replaced by a vendor-citation-backed alternative. Indicate whether Subwise has an official pricing page to cite; if not, the article should treat Subwise as illustrative or fictional.
