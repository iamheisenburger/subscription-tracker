Verdict — summary of verification

- Supported by sources:
  - Macro trend that subscription commerce is growing and more consumers pay for recurring services — supported by McKinsey and Zuora.
  - Practical consumer steps for finding and tracking subscriptions (export transactions, review 6–12 months, categorize vendors, set calendar reminders/alerts, cancel unused services, switch to annual for savings, watch small recurring charges, use subscription-tracking apps) — supported by Bankrate.
  - Recommendations to prioritize largest subscriptions and look for duplicates/overlaps are supported by Bankrate’s consumer guidance.

- Partially supported / context-sensitive
  - Dashboard and metrics language: tracking totals, monthly/annualized spend, category breakdowns, active count, next billing dates/renewal calendar, and trends are consumer-app features recommended by Bankrate; calling out business metrics such as “churn & onboarding rate” is more common in vendor/business analytics (Zuora/McKinsey speak to churn for subscription businesses) and is not directly described as a personal-finance metric in the provided consumer source.
  - Advice to “forecast monthly and annual subscription liabilities” follows logically from aggregating billing dates and amounts (Bankrate supports tracking next billing dates and totals) but the exact phrasing appears as an interpretation rather than a direct quote from the sources.

- Not supported / missing from the provided sources
  - Any claims specific to UseSubwise.app (product capabilities, centralized recurring payments, duplicate-detection implementation, one-click cancel, automated recommendations) are promotional and not substantiated by the three provided sources.
  - The numeric mini case study (specific starting/ending totals and calculated savings and yearly totals) is an illustrative example in the article and is not supported or verified by McKinsey, Zuora, or Bankrate.
  - Some operational details (e.g., normalizing vendor names via specific algorithms, enabling “one-click cancel/downgrade links” from a dashboard, applying coupons automatically) are tool-specific features not documented in the provided sources.

Recommendations to improve accuracy

- Replace brand-specific product claims with generic wording (e.g., “subscription-tracking apps” or “subscription dashboards”) unless you can cite vendor documentation.
- Remove or flag the illustrative case study as an example rather than a sourced result unless you add an external citation that reproduces those numbers.
- If you want to keep “churn & onboarding rate” as a dashboard metric, note that it originates in business-level subscription analytics (Zuora, McKinsey) and clarify it’s a business metric rather than a standard personal-finance metric.
