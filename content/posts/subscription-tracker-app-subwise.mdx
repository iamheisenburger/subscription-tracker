Fact-check summary — article claims vs. provided sources

Supported (directly or plausibly supported by Subwise site and industry sources):
- Core functionality of a subscription tracker (detect recurring payments, show upcoming renewals, send alerts, categorize recurring spend, provide analytics, and offer cancellation guidance) — supported by the Subwise product site (usesubwise.app) which describes these capabilities as product features.
- Security best-practices to check before connecting accounts (read-only access, encryption, limited data retention, transparent integrations) — Subwise states it follows industry security practices; recommending read-only/encrypted connections and minimal data retention is consistent with Subwise's security messaging. Use Subwise for product-specific claims about how it implements these practices.
- The subscription economy is a significant, growing segment of commerce and subscription models are widely used — supported by Statista (subscription economy topic) and by Investopedia's overview of the subscription business model which explains why recurring billing is common.
- Subwise offers a free tier and premium plans (the article's statement that Subwise provides a free tier and paid plans) — supported by the Subwise site.

Partially supported / plausible but not fully verified in the provided sources:
- Specific feature details such as “bank-level encryption (e.g., AES-256)” — Subwise states it uses industry-grade protection, but the provided sources do not verify the exact encryption algorithm (AES-256). The article’s recommendation (look for bank-level encryption) is sensible, but the specific algorithm should be confirmed on Subwise’s security or technical documentation before asserting it.
- Statements about how many apps implement particular cancellation automation flows (e.g., “Some can initiate cancellation flows for supported services, but full automated cancellations with authorization are uncommon”) — Subwise advertises guided cancellation help; broader market prevalence of automated cancellation capabilities is not documented in the three provided sources and so is only partially supported.
- Pricing model categorization (free tier, freemium/subscription, one-time purchase rare) — Subwise’s offering of free/premium tiers is supported, but the article’s categorization of the market as a whole is a reasonable generalization rather than a sourced market fact in the provided materials.

Unsupported / not verified by the provided sources (claims that need additional evidence):
- Numerical savings claim “many users … save anywhere from $10 to $100+ per month” — no specific user savings figures or study supporting that range are contained in the three provided sources. This is plausible but anecdotal and should be labeled as an estimate or backed by user data or a study.
- The recommendation threshold “Anyone with more than 2 recurring payments” as a firm rule — this is a practical suggestion/opinion in the article, not an evidence-backed threshold in the supplied sources.

Notes and suggested edits for accuracy in the article
- When mentioning technical security specifics (AES-256 or exact encryption standards), either cite Subwise’s security documentation or remove the specific algorithm and use a neutral phrasing such as “bank-grade / industry-standard encryption” unless the exact standard is documented.
- For market prevalence statements (how many apps can auto-cancel services or typical savings amounts), label them clearly as anecdotal or provide empirical sources (studies, aggregated user data) to substantiate numeric claims.
- Where the article gives prescriptive thresholds (e.g., >2 subscriptions), present them as recommendations rather than hard facts.

Overall assessment: The article’s product-feature and security guidance largely align with Subwise’s own site and with general industry descriptions of subscription trackers and the subscription economy (Statista, Investopedia). A few quantified or market-wide statements in the article are anecdotal and are not directly supported by the three provided sources; those should be qualified or sourced.
