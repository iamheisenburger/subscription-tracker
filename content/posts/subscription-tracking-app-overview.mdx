Summary of fact-check: I reviewed the article's main factual claims against the provided sources. Many high-level claims about types of subscription trackers, feature tradeoffs (convenience vs privacy), examples of apps, common pricing patterns (freemium + contingency fees + one-time/manual app pricing), enterprise vs consumer product separation, and several market/trend points are supported by the cited sources. A few specific numeric or absolute claims in the article (notably the exact USD 492 billion figure for the 2024 "subscription economy") were not verifiable from the provided source summaries and should be confirmed by checking the original market report PDF or data table.

Validated claims (supported by provided sources):
- Subscription trackers fall into automated bank-linked aggregators, manual/privacy-first trackers, and enterprise subscription-management platforms (supported: CNBC Select review; App Store listings for Bobby and Subby; Global Growth Insights). 
- Automated trackers typically connect to bank/card accounts via tokenized partners (Plaid/Finicity/Yodlee) and scan transaction feeds to identify recurring payments; this is described in the CNBC Select Truebill review and security/connector guidance (CNBC Select, NerdWallet explainer). 
- Manual trackers (e.g., Bobby, Subby) let users add subscriptions manually and appeal to privacy-conscious users (supported: App Store listings for Bobby and Subby; GoBankingRates/Forbes app roundups). 
- Many aggregator services offer cancellation/concierge and negotiation services and may charge contingency or commission fees; users should review fee terms (supported: CNBC Select Truebill review; Forbes Advisor). 
- Enterprise subscription-management platforms (Chargebee, Recurly, Zuora, Stripe Billing, etc.) are merchant-focused solutions for billing, dunning, revenue recognition, and analytics rather than consumer subscription trackers (supported: Global Growth Insights market report notes and vendor listings). 
- Trends: automation/AI for detection and recommendations, and interest in virtual cards/embedded payments for subscription control, are identified in market commentary (Global Growth Insights; Retail Banker International). 
- Streaming subscriptions are highly prevalent in U.S. households; TV Technology reports (citing Parks Associates data) that streaming subscriptions reach a very high share (article notes 91% of U.S. internet households). 
- Security best practices to check on product pages include tokenized bank connections, encryption in transit and at rest, and audit/compliance claims (SOC2); CNBC Select and NerdWallet materials discuss these protections for aggregators.

Claims needing verification or clarification (not sufficiently supported by the provided sources):
- The exact numeric claim "global subscription economy was estimated near USD 492 billion in 2024." The article cites Grand View Research; Grand View Research is the appropriate source, but I could not verify the precise USD 492 billion figure from the provided summary link alone — please confirm the exact number and citation location in the Grand View Research report or dataset.
- Some specific operational or percentage figures (for example, a sample contingency fee of "30%" used in the ROI example) are illustrative in the article but are not universal; contingency percentages vary by vendor and should be confirmed on each vendor's pricing/terms page (Forbes Advisor and CNBC Select discuss existence of contingency fees but do not prescribe a universal percentage).

Recommendations for corrections / safe wording:
- When quoting numeric market-size figures (e.g., USD 492 billion), cite the exact page or table from the Grand View Research report and include the date/version. If that exact figure cannot be located, replace with a qualified statement (e.g., "large/multi‑hundred‑billion dollar market" or "multi‑billion opportunity per Grand View Research") until verified.
- When indicating that a specific app uses a specific connector (Plaid/Finicity/Yodlee), prefer phrasing like "many aggregators partner with Plaid/Finicity/Yodlee" unless the vendor's documentation explicitly names the partner (CNBC Select confirms that aggregators commonly use such partners; check each vendor's security page for the exact partner name).
- For contingency fee examples, clarify that percentages vary by vendor and that the example is illustrative, not guaranteed.

Conclusion: The article's structural claims, product taxonomy, recommended feature checklist, security considerations and persona guidance align with the provided sources. Verify and cite the exact Grand View Research market-size figure and any vendor-specific numeric fees before publishing those exact numbers.
