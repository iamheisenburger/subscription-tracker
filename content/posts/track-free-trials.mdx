Summary of fact-check

- Supported (accurate per provided sources):
  - The FTC warns about "negative-option" offers and advises consumers to read terms, note renewal dates, and use cancellation/dispute processes (FTC).  
  - WalletHub reports typical subscription-waste figures in the neighborhood of $33/month (≈ $395/year) based on cited surveys (WalletHub).  
  - Industry data show materially higher conversion rates when cards are collected up-front; GrowthUnhinged's free-to-paid conversion report provides the conversion-rate context cited (higher card-upfront conversions vs. lower medians for free-to-paid).  
  - The "immediate-cancel" tactic (cancel at signup and retain trial access) is described as working for many streaming/SaaS vendors, with the caveat it doesn't always apply (Gear Patrol).  
  - Calendar reminders and the recommendation to set reminders 24–72 hours before renewal are consistent with Digital Trends guidance.  
  - Virtual-card controls (merchant-locked and single-use cards) are available from providers such as Privacy.com and are promoted as a method to prevent unwanted charges; Privacy.com documents these features and limitations.  
  - Automated subscription managers (e.g., Rocket Money / Truebill) detect recurring charges by scanning linked transaction data and can offer cancellation assistance, typically requiring account linking and sometimes paid tiers (CNBC).  
  - Apple and Google provide built-in subscription management screens (Apple Support, Google Play Help) to view and cancel platform-billed subscriptions.  
  - Monthly statement audits and other trimming practices are standard recommendations in consumer tech coverage (PCMag, Palos Publishing/TrackMySubs guidance for scaling). 

- Less-supported or unsupported / needs editing:
  - The article names specific bank/card services (example: "Capital One Eno") as providers of in-app virtual card numbers. That specific example is not supported by the provided sources; remove or cite a source that documents that offering.  
  - The closing reference to usesubwise.app (downloadable spreadsheet/calendar import) is not present among the provided sources and thus is unverified here; remove or source it.  
  - A reference in the pro tips to "article.hiddenmoneyfinder.com" is not present in the supplied sources and is unverified; remove or replace with a cited source.  

Verdict: The guide's central recommendations (track trials at signup, use calendar reminders, consider immediate-cancel where vendors permit it, use virtual cards to block unwanted charges, use automated managers if comfortable linking accounts, and audit statements monthly) are supported by the cited FTC guidance and the consumer/tech coverage provided. A few named examples and outbound links in the original article are not verifiable from the supplied sources and should be removed or replaced with proper citations.
