# Console Debug Analysis

Based on the console output, I can see several key issues:

## ‚ùå Issues Identified

1. **Environment validation failed** - Multiple instances
2. **TIER DEBUG DATA** - Partial logs visible
3. **AutoTierSync** - Running but may be failing

## üîç Next Steps

To get the complete analysis, please:

1. **Visit the full debug endpoint** directly in your browser:
   ```
   https://usesubwise.app/api/debug-tier-issue
   ```

2. **Check raw Clerk data**:
   ```  
   https://usesubwise.app/api/debug-clerk
   ```

3. **Look for these specific items in the JSON response:**
   - `problemAnalysis.issues` - List of detected problems
   - `manualAnalysis.shouldBePremiumReasons` - Why you should be premium
   - `environment.premiumPlanIdValue` - Current plan ID setting
   - `clerkRawData.publicMetadata` - Your subscription metadata

## üìã What to Share

Please copy the **entire JSON response** from the debug endpoints so I can see:
- Exact environment variable values
- Your actual Clerk metadata
- Specific error details
- Recommended fixes

This will tell us exactly why the tier detection is failing.
